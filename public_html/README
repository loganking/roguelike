This is an experiment in creating a js roguelike. Because it's intended to help me learn, I make no claims as to the quality of code.

To do:
 - separate code concerns into distinct files
 - make a view camera to only show a portion of the level at one time
 - add raytracing so that only "seen" paths are illuminated
 - change renderer to use canvas instead of dom
